# GSRI Code of Conduct

## What is this project

This project is a special project. It only serves as a versioning project for [our Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/team-gsri/CodeOfConduct/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Rules and standards

The following documents provide additional information on rules and standards applying to this project :

*   [GSRI code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
*   [Contributing to this project](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## How to use

The Code of Conduct on the master branch of this repository is the currently applicable Code of Conduct for GSRI GitHub projects. New versions of the code of conduct are applicable as soon as they are pushed on master. Changes to the Code of Conduct will be handled as through git branches, pull requests, history, etc ...

This project is intented to be used when creating a new project :

*   Create a new `/.github/README.md` file, and add a link to the code of conduct on this project's master branch
*   Create a new `/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file and add a link to the code of conduct on this project's master branch

The created project will then always point to the currently agreed Code of Conduct. Whenever our code of conduct is modified, it will point to the applicable code of conduct. There is no need to update the other projects documentation.
