# Groupe Sp√©cial de Reconnaissance et d'Intervention

Welcome on the GSRI Github home page !

The `Groupe Special de Reconnaissance et d'Intervention` is a french Arma 3 milsim unit. We are a non profit organization composed of benevolent members, which contributes to the development of Arma 3 oriented tools and mods. We play Arma 3 missions, both privates and publics, specialized in special forces oriented gameplay, with a high standard of discipline and realism. More information is available on *who we are* and *what we do* on [our official website](https://www.gsri.team) and [our discord server](https://discord.gg/bhMn4jd).
