# GSRI Code of Conduct

## Who we are and what we do

The `Groupe Special de Reconnaissance et d'Intervention` is a french Arma 3 milsim unit. We are a non profit organization composed of benevolent members, which contributes to the development of Arma 3 oriented tools and mods.

We play Arma 3 missions, both privates and publics, specialized in special forces oriented gameplay, with a high standard of discipline and realism. More information is available on *who we are* and *what we do* on [our official website](https://www.gsri.team) and [our discord server](https://discord.gg/bhMn4jd). Remark : both are only available in french.

## Our pledge 

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make the participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for any individual.

## Important note on violent content

This community is organised around a videogame which is **rated M by ESRB**, because it can contain *intense violence, blood, strong language*. This is why our community is moderated in a way suitable for people aged 17+. Although it is not specifically unsuitable for younger individuals, content that might hurt their sensibility will enventually occur. Content will not get moderated as promptly and thoroughly as what you'd expect from an all public community moderation team.

If you feel uneasy about yourself or your children being exposed to such content, you should consider navigating away from our content, or preventing your children from browsing our content.

## Rules of conduct

### Respectful behavior

* **Be polite.** Usual keywords such as *Hello*, *Please*, *Thank you*, and *Good bye* are efficient in making a place welcoming and inclusive.

* **Mind your writing.** Spell checkers have become very common and making too much spelling mistakes will make you look lazy and disrespectful. Use punctuation to make your text easier to read. Avoid using capitalized text in messages, which is interpreted as shouting, and is considered rude. Add space but do not abuse them.

* **Keep on topic.** Each place in our community is dedicated towards a single topic. If you want to relate two different topics, create a new thread if needed, and [Github Autolink](https://help.github.com/en/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls) them.

* **End your conversations.** Starting one and leaving is considered rude, so please at least tell when you're not intending to watch a topic anymore. This will help moderation team to categorize conversations and readers to know whether a conversation is expecting an answer or not.

* **Handle conflicts with respect.** Conflict is a natural social phenomenon, and can help progress when handled accordingly. Avoid resolving personal conflicts in public. Stick to the object of conflict and do not use ad hominem argumentum. Personal messages made public in order to disrepute someone will be deleted at once. If someone is harassing you in private, you shall [block them](https://help.github.com/en/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account). Our administration team is available if you need help in protecting yourself from harassment.

### Contribution best practices

* **Communicate in english.** We are a french community, but our aim is to contribute to the whole community. Using english helps players from other countries and speaking different languages to reuse our tools and enhance them.

* **Do not proliferate messages.** Only post messages if you have content to provide. If you want to react to other contributor messages, you shall use emojis to do so. We use the following convention :
  * :+1: `:+1:` means **yes / agree**
  * :-1: `:-1:` means **no / disagree**
  * :hand: `:hand:` means **I volunteer**
  
* **Respect coding styles.** Both official and informal ones. This helps keeping readability and maintenance at reasonable levels.

* **Comment your code.** Be reasonable on the amount though, and remember that code is about *hows* and comments about *whys*. If you're code has no comments or a lot of them, you're probably doing something wrong.

* **Coordinate with the community.** This will prevent you from wasting energy on a topic already being worked on or focusing on more critical matters. The best place to coordinate is on our [GSRI official discord server](https://discord.gg/bhMn4jd).

* **Always ensure licensing compatibility.** Our projects are protected by different licenses, depending on the nature and function of the software. You should read and acknowledge license terms before contributing. If you want to include licensed third party content in your contributions, ensure the project license is compatible with your content. When in doubt ask the question.
