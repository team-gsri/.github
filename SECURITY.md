# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

By default, only the latest version builded from branch `master` is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

A vulnerability can be reported as an issue giving instructions on how to reproduce. An other way is to reach us on our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/bhMn4jd) and ask for an executive member. However, keep in mind that english is not the native language of most of our members, thus opening an issue should be the preferred way of reporting vulnerabilities.

## Bug bounties

There is no bug bounty program in place in our organization. We will not deliver any bounty for reported bugs or vulnerabilities.
