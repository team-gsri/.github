# Contributing to GSRI repositories

This documentation provides guidelines and standard procedures to contribute to our project. It is a generic documentation which may be overriden on a per-project basis. Please check the `.guithub\CONTRIBUTING.md` file of projects for additional instructions.

## Ways to contribute to GSRI projects

There are two ways of contributing to our projects :

1. Suggest ideas and feedback
1. Contribute to the source code

**Note:** in order to contribute to the source code you need to own a github.com account.

## How to suggest ideas and feedback

*We are in the process of writing this documentation*

## Occasional contribution to the source code

**Note:** *this procedure is for non-GSRI occasional contributors. As such you are not granted write access to our repository, but you still may provide pull request from forked repositories.*

### Fork the repository

The first step in order to contribute is to fork our repository. This basically means you will create your own copy of our repository. In order to do so, just click on the `Fork` button in the top right of your screen.

That's all.

### Clone the repository

You need to use a git client in order to download and synchronize your work with the repository. If you don't know how to use git, we suggest you use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

Once git client installed, go to your forked project repository on github.com, and click the green `Clone or download` button on the right side of the webpage, then click `Open in Desktop` in the tooltip. Github Desktop will open and ask you where to download the source code. Select a directory of choice, and once selected, click `Clone` ; Github Desktop will download the sources on your computer.

### Modify the sources

You can now work on the source code with your favorite editor. If you don't have one, we suggest you use [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which integrates well with Github Dekstop. If you are modifying a mission, please follow guidelines below on *How to contribute to Arma 3 missions*.

### Commit and Push your modifications
### Keeping repositories synced
### Open a pull request to upstream

## Regular contribution to the source code
